# python
I just made this python code, it converts the output into a gif file but the results are amazing. 

Here is a walkthrough on how to get this program to work properly

1. Requirements
To run , you must be able to:
• 	Open Command Prompt
• 	Install Python
• 	Install Python packages using pip
• 	Run Python scripts from the command line
If you cannot do these things, stop here.

Packages needed for this file encludes
  python
  numpy
  matplotlib
  pillow

  then when you run convergence.py through cmd  it will create a stunning gif that will be 692mb of pure awe!!!
